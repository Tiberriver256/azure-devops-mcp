- [x] **Task 0.7**: Fix MCP Server Implementation
  - **Role**: Full-Stack Developer
  - **Phase**: Research
  - **Description**: Fix the Azure DevOps MCP server implementation to correctly use the MCP SDK. Currently, the server is not properly implementing the MCP protocol, causing connection errors when trying to use it with the inspector.
  - **Notes**:
    - **How we discovered the issue**:
      - Attempted to connect to our server with the MCP inspector
      - Received error: "TypeError: transport.onMessage is not a function at AzureDevOpsServer.connect"
      - Root cause: We're incorrectly implementing the MCP server protocol
    
    - **What we can learn from the GitHub implementation**:
      - GitHub implementation in `project-management/reference/mcp-server/src/github/index.ts` shows the correct pattern
      - They directly use the `Server` class from the SDK rather than creating a custom class
      - They register handlers using `server.setRequestHandler()` for specific request schemas
      - They have a clear pattern for tool implementation and error handling
    
    - **Key differences in implementation**:
      - GitHub uses `import { Server } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js"`
      - They register request handlers with `server.setRequestHandler(ListToolsRequestSchema, async () => {...})`
      - Tool implementations follow a switch/case pattern based on the tool name
      - They connect to the transport using `await server.connect(transport)`
      - Our implementation attempts to handle transport messages directly which is incorrect
    
    - **Learning resources**:
      - Reference implementation in `project-management/reference/mcp-server/`
      - MCP SDK documentation
      - The specific schema structure shown in the GitHub reference

    - **Specific Changes Required**:
      1. Server Class Changes:
         - Replace our custom `McpServer` usage with `Server` from SDK
         - Remove our custom `connect()` method implementation
         - Move Azure DevOps connection logic to tool handlers
      
      2. Tool Registration Changes:
         - Replace our custom `tool()` method with proper request handlers
         - Implement `ListToolsRequestSchema` handler to declare available tools
         - Implement `CallToolRequestSchema` handler with switch/case for tool execution
         - Move tool implementations into separate modules like GitHub's pattern
      
      3. Transport Handling:
         - Remove custom transport handling code
         - Let SDK handle transport via `server.connect(transport)`
         - Ensure proper error handling and response formatting
      
      4. Configuration:
         - Keep Azure DevOps config but integrate it with SDK server config
         - Move tool-specific config into tool modules
         - Ensure proper typing for all configurations

- [x] **Task 1.2**: Implement `list_organizations` using Axios with tests
  - **Role**: Full-Stack Developer
  - **Phase**: Completion
  - **Description**: Implement the list_organizations tool which allows users to retrieve all Azure DevOps organizations accessible to the authenticated user. This tool will use Axios for direct API calls rather than the WebApi client.
  - **Research Findings**:
    - The organizations API is not directly supported by the azure-devops-node-api library, requiring Axios for implementation
    - Retrieving organizations requires a two-step process:
      1. First get the user profile: `GET https://app.vssps.visualstudio.com/_apis/profile/profiles/me?api-version=6.0`
      2. Extract the `publicAlias` from the profile response
      3. Use the `publicAlias` to get organizations: `GET https://app.vssps.visualstudio.com/_apis/accounts?memberId={publicAlias}&api-version=6.0`
    - Authentication requires a PAT token sent via Basic Auth header
    - Response will include organization name, ID, and URL
    - The setup_env.sh script provides a working example of this API call sequence
  - **Implementation Details**:
    - Created the organizations module with the listOrganizations function
    - Implemented proper error handling for authentication failures
    - Added the tool to the server.ts file
    - Created comprehensive tests that verify all functionality
    - All tests are passing with good code coverage
    - Added documentation in docs/tools/organizations.md
