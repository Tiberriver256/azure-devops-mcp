## Current Tasks In Progress

- [ ] **Task A.1**: Research and document Azure Identity implementation options 
  - **Role**: Technical Architect
  - **Phase**: Research
  - **Description**: Research DefaultAzureCredential and related Azure Identity SDKs, determine ideal authentication flow using Azure CLI credentials, and document findings and implementation approach.
  - **Notes**:
    - **Azure Identity SDK Overview**:
      - The `@azure/identity` package provides various credential types for authenticating with Azure services
      - Key credential types include `DefaultAzureCredential`, `AzureCliCredential`, `ChainedTokenCredential`, and others
      - These credentials can be used with Azure DevOps by obtaining a bearer token and using it with the `BearerCredentialHandler`
    
    - **DefaultAzureCredential**:
      - Provides a simplified authentication experience by trying multiple credential types in sequence
      - Attempts to authenticate using environment variables, managed identity, Azure CLI, Visual Studio Code, and other methods
      - Ideal for applications that need to work in different environments (local development, Azure-hosted) without code changes
      - For Azure DevOps, it requires the resource ID `499b84ac-1321-427f-aa17-267ca6975798` to obtain the correct token scope
    
    - **AzureCliCredential**:
      - Authenticates using the Azure CLI's logged-in account
      - Requires the Azure CLI to be installed and the user to be logged in (`az login`)
      - Good for local development scenarios where developers are already using the Azure CLI
      - Can be used as a fallback mechanism in a `ChainedTokenCredential`
    
    - **Implementation Approach**:
      - Create an abstraction layer for authentication that supports both PAT and Azure Identity methods
      - Implement a factory pattern to create the appropriate credential based on configuration
      - Use `DefaultAzureCredential` as the primary Azure Identity method with `AzureCliCredential` as a fallback
      - Update the configuration to support specifying the authentication method (PAT, AAD, DefaultAzureCredential)
      - Implement proper error handling and logging for authentication failures
    
    - **Integration with Azure DevOps Node API**:
      - The Azure DevOps Node API supports bearer token authentication via the `BearerCredentialHandler` class
      - Tokens obtained from Azure Identity can be used with this handler to authenticate API requests
      - Example: `const authHandler = new BearerCredentialHandler(token.token); const connection = new WebApi(orgUrl, authHandler);`
    
    - **Configuration Requirements**:
      - For PAT: `AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT` and `AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG_URL`
      - For DefaultAzureCredential: `AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG_URL` and potentially `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` depending on the environment
      - New configuration option: `AZURE_DEVOPS_AUTH_METHOD` to specify which authentication method to use
  
  - **Sub-tasks**:

    - [x] Determine ideal authentication flow using Azure CLI credentials
    - [x] Document findings and implementation approach
