## Current Tasks In Progress

- [ ] **Task 1.2**: Implement `list_organizations` using Axios with tests
  - **Role**: Full-Stack Developer
  - **Phase**: Implementation
  - **Description**: Implement the list_organizations tool which allows users to retrieve all Azure DevOps organizations accessible to the authenticated user. This tool will use Axios for direct API calls rather than the WebApi client.
  - **Research Findings**:
    - The organizations API is not directly supported by the azure-devops-node-api library, requiring Axios for implementation
    - Retrieving organizations requires a two-step process:
      1. First get the user profile: `GET https://app.vssps.visualstudio.com/_apis/profile/profiles/me?api-version=6.0`
      2. Extract the `publicAlias` from the profile response
      3. Use the `publicAlias` to get organizations: `GET https://app.vssps.visualstudio.com/_apis/accounts?memberId={publicAlias}&api-version=6.0`
    - Authentication requires a PAT token sent via Basic Auth header
    - Response will include organization name, ID, and URL
    - The setup_env.sh script provides a working example of this API call sequence
  - **Notes**:
    - Authentication must be properly handled with PAT token in Axios headers
    - Error handling needs to account for both API steps failing
    - Response should be transformed to a consistent format (similar to other Azure DevOps tools)
    - API version 6.0 is confirmed working in production environments
  - **Sub-tasks**:
    - [x] Create test fixtures for mocking both profile and accounts API responses
    - [x] Implement helper functions for authentication headers with Axios
    - [x] Write the profile API request function
    - [x] Write the organizations API request function
    - [x] Implement the complete handler with error handling and response transformation
    - [x] Write unit tests for each component and integration tests for the full handler
    - [x] Document the tool's usage, parameters, and response format
  - **Implementation Progress**:
    - Created the organizations module with the listOrganizations function
    - Implemented proper error handling for authentication failures
    - Added the tool to the server.ts file
    - Created comprehensive tests that verify all functionality
    - All tests are passing with good code coverage
    - Added documentation in docs/tools/organizations.md
