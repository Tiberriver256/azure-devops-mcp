# Azure DevOps Test Plans - create_test_plan Feature Research

## Overview of Test Plans in Azure DevOps
Test Plans in Azure DevOps are used to organize and manage testing activities within a project. They provide a structured way to plan, organize, and track testing efforts. A test plan typically contains test suites and test cases that define what should be tested and how.

## API Endpoint for Creating Test Plans
The API endpoint for creating a test plan in Azure DevOps is:

```
POST https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_apis/test/plans?api-version=5.0
```

### Required Parameters:
- **organization**: The name of the Azure DevOps organization.
- **project**: Project ID or project name where the test plan will be created.
- **api-version**: Version of the API to use (5.0).

### Request Body:
The request body should contain a JSON object with the following properties:

- **name** (required): Name of the test plan.
- **area** (optional): Area path to which the test plan belongs.
- **iteration** (optional): Iteration path for the test plan.
- **description** (optional): Description of the test plan.
- **startDate** (optional): Start date for the test plan.
- **endDate** (optional): End date for the test plan.
- **state** (optional): State of the test plan.
- **owner** (optional): Owner of the test plan.
- **build** (optional): Build ID whose quality is tested by the tests in this plan.
- **buildDefinition** (optional): The Build Definition that generates a build for this plan.
- **releaseEnvironmentDefinition** (optional): Release Environment for deployment and running automated tests.
- **testOutcomeSettings** (optional): Settings for test outcomes.

### Response:
A successful operation returns a `200 OK` response with a `TestPlan` object containing details of the created test plan.

## Authentication:
The API uses OAuth2 authentication with the following scopes:
- **vso.test_write**: Grants the ability to read, create, and update test plans, cases, results, and other test management related artifacts.

## Examples:
Here are some example scenarios for creating test plans:

1. **Basic Test Plan**:
```json
{
  "name": "Sprint 1 Testing"
}
```

2. **Test Plan with Area and Iteration**:
```json
{
  "name": "Release Testing",
  "area": {
    "name": "MyProject\\Quality assurance"
  },
  "iteration": "MyProject\\Release 1"
}
```

3. **Test Plan with Description and Dates**:
```json
{
  "name": "Feature X Testing",
  "description": "Testing plan for Feature X implementation",
  "startDate": "2023-06-01",
  "endDate": "2023-06-15"
}
```

## Implementation Considerations:
1. The MCP Server handler for `create_test_plan` should accept all the relevant parameters with appropriate validation.
2. All required fields must be provided and validated before making the API request.
3. Authentication tokens should be properly managed and secured.
4. Error handling should be implemented to handle various failure scenarios.
5. The response should be appropriately formatted to provide clear information to the client.

## Next Steps:
- Determine which parameters should be required vs. optional for the MCP Server handler
- Define validation rules for each parameter
- Design error handling approach
- Implement authentication mechanism
